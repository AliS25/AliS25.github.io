# My Website

My first website. This website has a background, title, two images that can be switched, lists, and links. The website also asks its users for a name and saves it for the next time the website is opened. Users can also change the name they provided. One of the links leads to my homepage. My homepage has a link to my first website, video files, an audio file, and an SVG. It also has a custom table and a link to send me emails that have a pre-set subject and initial text.
