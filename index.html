  <h2>Ali Sbeih 
    <hr>
    Amherst College '25, Computer Science Major</h2>
  <p>Hello,
<br>
    My name is Ali Sbeih, and I’m a sophomore at Amherst College majoring in computer science. 
    In high school, I’ve had ample experience teaching people my age and young children sciences and English.
    So far, I've taken the following computer science courses: Intro Computer Science I, Intro Computer Science II, and Data Structures.
    This summer, I worked as a Gregory S. Call Academic Intern, assisting in developing a new course, “Algorithms and Visualization.” 
    I'm currently taking a Machine Learning course and an Algorithms course and developing my Android mobile application development skills.  Additionally, I’m serving as a Lab TA for Intro Computer Science I.
