  <h2>Ali Sbeih 
    <hr>
    Amherst College '25, Computer Science and Math Double Major</h2>
  <p>
    Hello, my name is Ali Sbeih, and I’m a junior at Amherst College. 
    So far, I've taken the following Computer Science courses at Amherst College: Intro Computer Science I, Intro Computer Science II, Data Structures, 
    Algorithms, Machine Learning, and Algorithms and Visualization. I also took an Android mobile application development course through the 
    CodePath organization. Last Summer, I worked as a Gregory S. Call Academic Intern, assisting in developing a new course, 
    “Algorithms and Visualization.”   Last year, I served as a Lab TA for Intro Computer Science I, a Math TA for Intermediate Calculus among 
    other things, a peer tutor for Data Structures course, and an assistant for the AI in the liberal arts initiative.
