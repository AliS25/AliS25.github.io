<!--The line below inserts an image into the page. We need to tell the HTML where the image is. 
  The image is inside the images directory, which is in the same directory as index.html. 
  To walk down the file structure from index.html to our image, the file path we'd need 
  is images/your-image-filename.-->
<!--Some general rules for file paths:
- To link to a target file in the same directory as the invoking HTML file, just use the filename, my-image.jpg.
To reference a file in a subdirectory, write the directory name in front of the path, plus a forward slash, subdirectory/my-image.jpg.
To link to a target file in the directory above the invoking HTML file, write two dots, ../my-image.jpg.
You can combine these as much as you like, for example ../subdirectory/another-subdirectory/my-image.jpg.-->
<!--img element has no closing tag or content because its purpose is to 
embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears not affect content.-->
<!--embeds the  image via the src (source) attribute. Tbe alt (alternative) 
attribute specifies descriptive text for users who cannot see the image.-->

<img src="images/websiteone.jpg" alt="My test image">

<figcaption>Click on the image</figcaption>
</figure>
<!--we specify that this line is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:-->
<!--This is an element it consists of the opening tag, content, and closing tag respectively-->
    <p>This is my first website!</p>

<!--Elements can also have attributes which contain extra information that you don't want in the content
  An attribute consists of an attribute name and an attribute value. Here, it's class and note respecitvely. 
  The class attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier 
  that can be used to target it and any other elements with the same class value with style information and other things.-->
